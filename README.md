# A Work-in-Progress Game Engine 

**Tech Stack:** C++, Lua, CMake, Git, Raylib  

• **Component-Based Architecture** – GameObject system with a hierarchical scene graph.  
• **Lua Scripting** – Integrated as components for runtime behavior modification.  
• **Serialization** – Custom save/load system for game states and assets.  
• **GUI Editor** – Built an in-engine tool for scene and asset editing.  
• **Rendering** – Lighting, normal mapping, and custom material format.  
• **Animation** – GPU skinning and playback system.  
• **Physics** – Custom rigid-body system with collision detection.  

Designed and implemented core game engine systems, blending **graphics, physics, scripting, and tooling** into a cohesive framework. **Developed entirely as a solo project.**
